The purpose of this tool is to estimate the proportion and type of land consumption in a certain area.
In its current form it estimates the proportion of land consumed by buildings, parking lots, streets
, and other built-up areas, both in aggregate and proportionally amongst land use classes such as commercial, residential, and industrial. These findings are then reported back as two tables and a treemap.
